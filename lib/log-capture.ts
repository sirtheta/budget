 * must not itself construct the logger — and instrumentation.ts calls
 * startLogCapture() as the very first thing in register(), before any
 * `@/lib/logger` import anywhere below it.
 *
 * A second consequence of patching the process streams rather than adding a
 * destination to pino itself: every line that would show up in `docker logs`
 * ends up in the file, not just what happens to go through the shared
 * logger — a node-cron error, an uncaught exception's stack trace, anything
 * printed with a bare `console.log`.
